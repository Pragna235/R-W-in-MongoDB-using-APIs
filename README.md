# Reading and Writing to MongoDB-using-APIs

## Playbook
* Write the code
* Open terminal
*     npm install mongoose
*     npm install express
*     node server.js
* Once the DB is connected, open POSTMAN
*     http://localhost:3000/students
* Apply the API requests and observe the responses in both `POSTMAN` and in your `ATLAS` account
* For cloud services, publish the server on `render.com` and use that url to connect to your mongodb atlas
* Correctly note your `mongodb connection string`
